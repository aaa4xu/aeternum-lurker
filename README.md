# Aeternum lurker
Aeternum lurker is an automation script for New World that captures trading post buy orders and submits the data for analysis.

## Usage
1. Start New World and navigate to the trading post.
2. Run the script: `python main.py`

## How It Works
- The script utilizes game window management and image processing to automate the capture of orders from trading post.
- It periodically checks for items listed in the provided watchlist by making a GET request to the configured API endpoint.
- For each item, it navigates the trading post's search functionality, captures a screenshot, and processes it to extract order details.
- Processed data is then submitted to a specified API endpoint.

## Note
- This script is intended for educational and research purposes. Always follow the game's terms of service and use at your own risk.
- Modify `lurker/nwconfig.py` to match your game's UI layout for accurate screenshot capture.
- Ensure the API endpoints are correctly set up to receive the data.
